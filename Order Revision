Can be applied to any field as a suffix. So example is field is called "MyField" and UF-Code to call is UF-001 then make the field-name "MyField@UF:UF-001"



Then if the Universal Function you can work with the value using keywords:

 

$[B1DASHBOARDVALUE.STRING] or $[B1DASHBOARDVALUE.NUMBER] (if needed to be treated as a number)
